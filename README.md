# PyCirc
* **PyCirc** is a Python package for modeling and simulating simple Logic Circuits
  specifically designed for educational use in introductory computation and digital
  logic college level courses.
* As such, it was primarily tuned for readability, convenience, fast learning curve, and less for speed or industrial production.
* It is a light weight package especially designed for small/medium size circuits,
  such as those that are studied in introductory academic courses on the theory of computation
  and digital/electronic design.
* Its main characteristic is that a logic circuit can be easily defined by a series
  of simple Python commands, rather than an external static language.
* It is inteneded to be used by novice Python programmers and non-programmers (with tools such as Jupyter notebook or Google Colaboratory).
* But it allows more experienced Python programmers to make more sophisticated use with it.
* It can be a useful companion for theoretical course on computation models and languages who wish also to engage
  the students with some programming experience and skills.
  * It is currently used in such a course by the author (Hebrew book at http://samyzaf.com/afl.pdf).
  * It enables students to easily model and experiment with typical logic circuits, verify circuits designs,
     design and test circuits, and for exercises and problem solving.
  * It does provide an opportunity for students to develop and practice programming skills
     while covering the theoretical computation course.
* Substantial documentation is included in the following Jupyter notebook:
  * https://samyzaf.com/pycirc/pycircpl.html
  * Google Colaboratory notebook:
    * https://github.com/samyzaf/pycirc/blob/main/pycircpl.ipynb
      * Save as file and uppload to your Google Colab space.
      * Or simply save to your local drive and load it as a Jupyter notebook
* This is an early version. I will appreciate any comments/fixes/improvement-suggestions.
