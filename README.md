* **PyCirc** is a new Python package for modeling and simulating simple Logic Circuits
specifically designed for educational use in introductory computation and digital logic college course.
* As such, it was primarily tuned for readability, convenience, fast learning curve, and less for speed or industrial production.
* It is a light weight package especially designed for small scale circuits,
such as those that are studied in introductory academic courses on the theory of computation
and electronic design.
* Its main characteristic is that a digital circuit can be easily defined by a series of simple Python commands, rather than an
  external static language, which has a lot of advantages.
* Experienced Python programmers
* It can be a useful companion for theoretical course on computation models and languages who wish also to engage
   the students with some programming experience and skills.
  * It is planned to be use in such a course by the author (Hebrew book at http://samyzaf.com/afl.pdf).
  * It enables students to easily model and experiment with typical logic circuits, verify circuits designs,
     design and test circuits, and for problem solving.
  * It does provide an opportunity for students to develop practice some programming skills
     while covering the theoretical computation course.

* Substantial documentation is included in the following notebook:

  * Google Colaboratory notebook from:
    * https://samyzaf.com/pycirc/pycirc.ipynb
    * Copy it to your space and use it with Google Colaboratory or a a local Jupyter notebook
